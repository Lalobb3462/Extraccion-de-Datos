I love to travel and to connect to new people and cultures. Recently I came back to Portugal after living about a decade abroad. I lived in Salzburg and Linz - Austria, from where I returned back in the end of 2014. It was a great experience and it helped to exercise the languages I appreciated to learn before. To learn about the country and its culture was also important to me. I studied both universities of Dancing and of Opera Singing (Lisbon/Salzburg and Linz, respectively) and I use to feel home when creating new things. In Linz I had my own created group of theater, a year-project of an amazing exchange of artistic expressions, like music, dancing, theater, but also painting, video-art and free-exhibition. So, I'm interested in fine arts as well; and happy to be around artists! My little apartment has being the place to be when returned back in Portugal. Although, now the time to be back in the Nature has come and I may be happy to open the doors of my ""little and cosy palace"" in the centre of Lisbon to the ones who deserve it!

Questa passione mi ha portato in un viaggio di esplorazione di diverse aree come la ginnastica artistica, il kung fu, l'arrampicata, la capoeira, la danza, l'acroyoga, lo yoga, il sound-healing e la meditazione.
Avendo come base la mia laurea in Medicina, ho dato supporto alla mia ricerca nell'ambito del movimento e del bodywork sempre consapevole delle diverse forme e possibilità con cui si può esprimere il concetto di ""cura"". E' stato così che ho finalmente cominciato ad insegnare Acroyoga e Thai Massage nel 2017.
Ho incontrato nel massaggio tailandese una forma per connettermi alla parte più profonda di me stessa, sia dando un massaggio, che ricevendolo, o insegnando.
Vedo il massaggio tailandese come una pratica di meditazione e di cura complementare alla medicina tradizionale, sia per me che per gli altri.

Campo de Ourique is a neighborhood with a life of its own, it looks like a small village within Greater Lisbon. It is often referred to as the quietest neighborhood in the city of Lisbon and the one with the best living conditions, differentiating it from other urban areas that depend excessively on Shopping Centers. Weekdays and weekends seem indistinguishable, as the peaceful and paradoxically dynamic movement of people traverses the neighborhood every day of the week at the same pace.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-885484458445798934/original/5b378a10-6037-41ad-b1b2-4249ee25bce2.jpeg,25934419,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/25934419,Paulo,2015-01-11,"Lisbon, Portugal",I am very responsible with my hosts. ,within a day,80%,18%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/873ef540-3d46-4252-804f-2325ed7b604e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/873ef540-3d46-4252-804f-2325ed7b604e.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,2,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Lisboa, Portugal",Campo de Ourique,Lisboa,38.71642917266146,-9.163178507134164,Private room in rental unit,Private room,1,2.0,2 baths,1.0,1.0,"[""Cleaning products"", ""Essentials"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Hangers"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Oven"", ""Blender"", ""Shared gym nearby"", ""Coffee"", ""Shampoo"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Hot water"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Freezer"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Free washer \u2013 In unit"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Wifi"", ""Heating"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Gas stove"", ""Bed linens"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Elevator"", ""Dining table"", ""Shower gel""]",$30.00,15,90,6,15,90,90,15.0,90.0,,t,6,19,49,324,2024-09-14,1,1,1,2024-09-10,2024-09-10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Exempt,f,2,0,2,0,1.0
