I love to restore old buildings and give them life. That's why it's so nice to have guests and children playing and to look at the cottages and see smoke coming out from the chimneys or the table set outside for a nice meal. I became so addicted to this transformation - from old ruins to nice and comfortable apartments-  that in 2008 i bought a flat in Lisbon to restore and rent to visitors. I wish I could go on and on buying, restoring and renting.
Apart from this “hobby” that became my job, I also love to travel and get new ideas for my guests.
My father is a wine producer in the Douro Valley and I always try to find time to share a  bottle and knowledge about Portuguese wines with my guests. So, this is it, my 2 passions in life: the farm and the winery and of course my 2 girls, the odest is 16 and a one year old baby.

I became so addicted to this transformation - from old ruins to nice and comfortable apartments-  that in 2008 i bought a flat in Lisbon to restore and rent to visitors. I wish I could go on and on buying, restoring and renting.
